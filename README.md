## ü§ì Project Overview ##

Pet Society, is a platform that centers around animal profiling. Data collected enables the feature to track stray animal‚Äôs locations, health status and feeding schedules. Focus functions such as ‚ÄúPosts-with-Tags‚Äù, ‚ÄúLive-Chat‚Äù and ‚ÄúLocation services for last seen whereabouts‚Äù allows users to share and receive up-to-date information about the stray animals of interest better. We believe these functionalities will aid the community in the process of stray animal management and the identified social missions. The application is also inclusive to those who just want to create an account for their pets or follow other pets online.

  

All in all, our application aims to create greater public awareness and support for Singapore‚Äôs strays through the sharing of personal experiences and interaction with stray animals among the community.

  

## Why not create a channel on an existing social media platform ##

Social media platforms like Facebook, have a large community of people who look out and care for stray animals, however there are many of such communities with the same purpose which dilutes the effectiveness of it as they are not linked to each other. Users are dispersed across communities and thus the unfulfilled potential of collection and dissemination of information. Also, existing social media platforms lack specific features that would assist users in their effort to cater to these stray animals.
